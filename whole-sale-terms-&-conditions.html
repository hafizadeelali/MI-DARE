                    <h4>3.Products:</h4>
                    <p>MiDARE Cosmetics, LLC reserves the right to restrict the sale of any product line to specific
                        regions in its sole discretion and to exercise this right on a case-by-case basis. Please
                        acknowledge that any promotional offer, product line, or package size otherwise applicable to
                        any wholesale order may not be available in your region or jurisdiction.</p>

                    <h4>4. MSRP and MAP:</h4>
                    <p>All products purchased from MiDARE Cosmetics LLC must be sold at a minimum advertised price (MAP)
                        equal to or greater than MIDARE’s Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). The Minimum
                        Advertised Price is established by MIDARE and may be adjusted by MIDARE at such time and in such
                        amounts as it may determine at its sole discretion. All discounts offered by the re-seller must
                        be above the MAP.</p>

                    <h4>5. Wholesale Pricing:</h4>
                    <p>All prices are listed in US dollars. All authorized retailers will receive discount off the MSRP,
                        plus the cost of shipping. We cover the cost of postal insurance for any shipments through USPS.
                    </p>

                    <h4>6. Returns and Refunds:</h4>
                    <p> All returns must be made in writing directly to MiDARE Cosmetics, LLC within (14) days of
                        delivery listing both the invoice number and the reason for the return. No returns are permitted
                        without our prior approval and delivery instructions for transport. Shipping costs will be

                        shipping chargeable to the customer. Please email us with details of the product before
                        returning it.<br><br>
                        Once we receive your return, we will check it for the damage/defects mentioned in the return
                        request, and if we are convinced with your claim, a replacement will be shipped to you free of
                        any extra charges.

                        PayPal or a wire transfer/check. MiDARE Cosmetics, LLC does not accept electronic payments at
                        this time due to the cost involved. The order will come either directly from our warehouse or
                        from the manufacturing facility depending on the amount involved.
                    </p>

                    <h4>8. Shipping: </h4>
                    <p>Shipping is not included in the cost of goods. At checkout, all shipping fees are added and
                        displayed. Shipping rates and times are determined by the weight and size of the individual
                        item(s) and the shipping speed selected.
                    </p>

                        merchandise will be replaced, but will not be accepted if it is held for more than fourteen (14)

                    <h4>10. Delivery Window: </h4>
                    <p>Please allow at least (3) to (20) business days for your order to arrive, regardless of whether
                        the order is shipped from our warehouse or the manufacturing facility. If the order is shipped
                        from the manufacturing facility, please allow at least (10) extra days for delivery.

                        holidays, orders may not be shipped or fulfilled. Shipments may be delayed due to factors beyond

                        substantial delay in the dispatch of your parcel.
                    </p>

                    <h4>11. Backorders:</h4>
                    <p>YOut of stock goods will be back-ordered and shown on your invoice. If back-ordered goods are in
                        stock at the time of your next order, they will be added to your order without duplication.
                        Outstanding back-orders will be shown on each invoice. Please inform us if you want to cancel
                        any back-order or not have any back-orders listed at all.<br><br>

                        If we do not have the amount of the product ordered in our warehouse, we may have the order
                        shipped directly from the manufacturing facility. If we do not have the amount in stock at our
                        manufacturing facility, the product will be back-ordered and put on your next order if the
                        amount is in stock at the time of your next order.
                    </p>
